Hello World Colors is a Flutter-based application that puts a modern, colorful spin on the traditional "Hello World" program. In programming, "Hello World" programs are the quintessential first step for beginners, where a simple command displays the phrase "Hello, World!" on the screen. This "app" builds on this foundation by showcasing a variety of [named web colors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color), adding an interactive and visual element to the basic concept.

Each time the user taps the Shuffle button, Hello World Colors displays a random color from a wide range of web colors, complete with its name, like Slate Blue, Crimson, or Peach Puff. This feature not only introduces users to a spectrum of colors but also demonstrates the ease and flexibility of building user interfaces with Flutter. Additionally, the app includes a full-screen color preview and a handy option to copy the color's hexadecimal code directly to the clipboard.
